# HelpBuddy

Hello, I am Amitosh Solanki, CDAC certified FullStack Software developer from Sunbeam Pune, I have hands on experience in Java, SpringBoot, C++, C#, .NET, JavaScript, React.js, Agile, Selenium and AWS this knowledge helped me to make projects on SpringBoot and React.

I am fairly new to Android Development, but I tried my best to come up with a innovative and easy to use app for Elderly people.
In this app users need to add a phone number which will be a emergency contact in the app whenever user clicks the "EMERGENCY CALL" button it will call that number. When an elderly person is having an emergency or health complication they can use this to make a call quickly.

It also has a reminder feature to add medicine and water intake reminders on custom settimes.
